25121597,0,CDK4 amplification predicts recurrence of well-differentiated liposarcoma of the abdomen.,"The absence of CDK4 amplification in liposarcomas is associated with favorable prognosis. We aimed to identify the factors associated with tumor recurrence in patients with well-differentiated (WD) and dedifferentiated (DD) liposarcomas. From 2000 to 2010, surgical resections for 101 WD and DD liposarcomas were performed. Cases in which complete surgical resections with curative intent were carried out were selected. MDM2 and CDK4 gene amplification were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). There were 31 WD and 17 DD liposarcomas. Locoregional recurrence was observed in 11 WD and 3 DD liposarcomas. WD liposarcomas showed better patient survival compared to DD liposarcomas (P Level of CDK4 amplification determined by Q-PCR was associated with the recurrence of WD liposarcomas after surgical resection.",.,The absence of CDK4 amplification in liposarcomas is associated with favorable prognosis.

23852861,1,High level of CDK4 amplification is a poor prognostic factor in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma.,"The amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 is the main molecular feature of well-differentiated liposarcomas (WDLS) and dedifferentiated liposarcomas (DDLS). Although the diagnostic usefulness of this molecular characteristic in liposarcomas has been investigated, its prognostic utility of quantitative gene level has not been explored. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic significance of level of CDK4 amplification in MDM2-amplified WDLS/DDLS. MDM2 amplification in liposarcomas was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The copy number of MDM2 and CDK4 was further determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Among 56 MDM2-amplified liposarcomas, 30 cases were assigned as WDLS, and 26 as DDLS. When liposarcomas were classified by qPCR-determined CDK4 amplification levels, the high-CDK4 group showed significantly poorer progression free survival (P=0.001) and disease specific survival (P=0.033) than the low-CDK4 group. However, MDM2 amplification level did not show prognostic significance. In WDLS/DDLS, the level of CDK4 amplification was useful for prognosis prediction and precise stratification of patients for targeted therapy.","The amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 is the main molecular feature of well-differentiated liposarcomas (WDLS) and dedifferentiated liposarcomas (DDLS).

14694526,4,Evaluation of MDM2 and CDK4 amplification by real-time PCR on paraffin wax-embedded material: a potential tool for the diagnosis of atypical lipomatous tumours/well-differentiated liposarcomas.,"Atypical lipomatous tumours/well-differentiated liposarcomas and dedifferentiated liposarcomas are characterized by 12q13-15 region amplification. In contrast, this molecular event has not been reported in benign lipomas. Within the 12q13-15 chromosomal region, the MDM2, SAS, HMGA2, and CDK4 genes are the most frequent targets of amplification.

Nevertheless, around 10% of these tumors do not amplify CDK4. To find substitutive alterations of CDK4 amplification, we analyzed a large series of liposarcomas by array-CGH, real-time genomic PCR, gene expression array, and real-time RT-PCR. We demonstrate that an alteration in the CDKN2A/CDKN2B/CDK4/CCND1 pathway is present in almost all cases without CDK4 amplification, thereby confirming the pivotal role of this pathway in liposarcoma oncogenesis. Moreover, we show that cell cycle and differentiation are driven by a subtle and complex balance between members of this pathway. Finally, we demonstrate that in tumors without amplification/overexpression of CDK4, the chromosome 1q21-1q23 region is a preferential partner of chromosome 12 amplicon, suggesting that the mechanism of amplification is slightly different in this group of tumors.","The MDM2 and CDK4 genes are the main targets of chromosome 12 amplification in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas.

19737942,7,Clinical and biological significance of CDK4 amplification in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas.,"We compared the clinical characteristics of a series of 143 WDLPS/DDLPS with amplification of both MDM2 and CDK4 (MDM2+/CDK4+) to a series of 45 WDLPS/DDLPS with MDM2 amplification and no CDK4 amplification (MDM2+/CDK4-). We used fluorescence in situ hybridization, real time quantitative reverse transcription PCR, and immunohistochemistry to explore the status of CCND1, P16INK4a, P14ARF, and RB1. We found that MDM2+/CDK4- WDLPS/DDLPS represent a distinct clinical subgroup with favorable prognostic features, including low-grade lipoma-like histology, peripheral location, and lower rate of recurrence. By using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we found that genomic aberrations expected to be alternative mechanisms for compensating the lack of CDK4 amplification, such as RB1 and CDKN2A deletions or CCND1 amplification, were very uncommon. In contrast, by using real time quantitative reverse transcription PCR and immunohistochemistry, we observed that overexpression of P16INK4a (and P14ARF) and CCND1 and reduced expression of RB1 were very frequent, independently of the CDK4 status. Our results underscore the complex coordinated regulation of the RB and p53 growth-control pathways in WDLPS/DDLPS. Because the absence of CDK4 amplification is not specifically counterbalanced by a genomic alteration of the CCND1/CDK4/P16INK4a/RB1/E2F pathway, CDK4 amplification may only represent a ""MDM2-HMGA2-helper"" in WDLPS/DDLPS tumorigenesis.",.,.,"We compared the clinical characteristics of a series of 143 WDLPS/DDLPS with amplification of both MDM2 and CDK4 (MDM2+/CDK4+) to a series of 45 WDLPS/DDLPS with MDM2 amplification and no CDK4 amplification (MDM2+/CDK4-).
